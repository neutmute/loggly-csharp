h3. Logging Events

Create a new @Logger@ with your input key:
<pre>var logger = new Logger("my-long-key-that-i-got-when-setting-up-my-http-input");</pre>

Use either a synchronous or asynchronous @Log@ method.

h3. Searching Events

First, setup the username/password you want to connect with:
<pre>LogglyConfiguration.Configure(c => c.AuthenticateWith("username", "oassword"));</pre>

Next, create a searcher with your domain:
<pre>var searcher = new Searcher("mydomain");</pre>

Finally, use the various @Search@ methods.

Note that searching happens synchronously.
